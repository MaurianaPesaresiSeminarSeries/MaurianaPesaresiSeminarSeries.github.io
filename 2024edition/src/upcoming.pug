        | Conventional methodologies face difficulties in striking a harmonious balance between data-driven learning and adherence to physical constraints, particularly when dealing with noisy datasets. To tackle this challenge, hybrid approaches are being explored, aiming to amalgamate the advantages of both Model-Based and Data-Driven methodologies to develop more robust models. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a hybrid approach, that presents a promising solution by integrating fundamental physical principles into model training, thereby enhancing generalization and interpretability. Despite the potential advantages of PINNs in reconciling physics-based constraints with data-driven learning, concerns persist regarding their tendency to generate unrealistic predictions. Nonetheless, a challenge arises over validating neural networks that represent a physical system characterized by unknown or partially known dynamics. Consequently, further research is required to refine the validation of AI-based systems, minimizing deviations from physical solutions. This presentation delves into the verification process of neural network models, with an emphasis on discerning the physical properties of real dynamical systems.
