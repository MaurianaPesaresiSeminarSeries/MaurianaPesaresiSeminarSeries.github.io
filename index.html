          <p>The characterization of k-uniform hypergraphs by their degree sequences, say k-sequences, has been a longstanding open problem for k>2. Very recently its decision version was proved to be NP-complete by Deza et al. Formally, the decision version of the problem is: Given Ï€=(d1,d2,â€¦,dn) a non increasing sequence of positive integers, is Ï€ the degree sequence of a k-uniform simple hypergraph? The NP-completeness reduction uses, in an intermediate step, a subclass of 3-uniform hypergraphs whose incidence matrices are computed starting from a sequence of integer numbers. In general, the complexity of the reconstruction of the elements of such a subclass is unknown.</p>

            In recent years, many companies and private users have taken advantage of cloud services to store large collections of data, with a huge saving on infrastructure and maintenance costs.
            Therefore, each time a user wants to retrieve information from the cloud it needs to issue a query and contact the cloud provider, which manages the data collectionon behalf of the owner.
            In this scenario, however, nothing prevents the provider from sending back tampered or incomplete results.
            As a consequence,all users must be able to detect any inconsistency in what they receive.
            This problem is known in the literature as authenticated query processing and its solution hinges on the design of efficient algorithms and cryptographic protocols for data retrieval and authentication.
            In this talk we will explore some state-of-the-art techniques to address it and discuss some of the challenges we must face when dealing with query processing in the context of blockchain environments.
