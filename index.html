          <p>Adaptive Video Streaming (ABR) has significantly enhanced the landscape of video delivery by prioritizing user experience. The success of video transmission hinges on minimizing interruptions while ensuring compatibility with the user's device. Consequently, the development of novel technologies in this realm has become imperative, with a growing emphasis on performance measurement from a user-centric perspective. Techniques rooted in machine learning, cloud, fog, and edge computing have emerged as crucial enablers for maximizing bandwidth efficiency and reducing unnecessary waste. In this presentation, we aim to explore the multifaceted challenges and promising research avenues in adaptive video transmission, with a specific focus on enhancing user experience. We will showcase state-of-the-art techniques and research endeavors geared towards optimizing Adaptive Streaming. These efforts are geared towards minimizing bandwidth waste and enhancing transmission quality by continuously evaluating feedback from both network environment conditions and user interactions. Through this exploration, we endeavor to shed light on the evolving landscape of adaptive video transmission and its pivotal role in delivering seamless, high-quality viewing experiences to users.</p>

Advances in neural networks have enabled the representation of objects as numerical vectors, simplifying Similarity Search into calculations of distances within vector spaces. Among the various techniques developed to address this challenge, graph-based methods stand out. These methods, which connect vectors through edges to facilitate the search process, have proven to be the most efficient and promising approach.</p>

To combat this, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) emerged in the 1990s, advocating for a tailored curriculum. Studies emphasize how appropriate use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can accelerate the adoption and application of UDL in various educational systems and benefit students with disabilities. Among ICTs, Virtual and Augmented Reality appear to have great potential for UDL as they are attention-grabbing and create immersive, personalized experiences that are difficult to replicate in person. Despite their potential, VR and AR are still little used in real educational contexts and most proposals in the literature relate to children. The seminar will focus on a systematic literature review that identifies research gaps, such as the lack of guidelines that inform and guide the design and development of AR apps, and the lack of attention given to the orientation and university education of students with disabilities. It identifies a number of open problems holding back the use of immersive technologies in the university environment and concludes with suggestions for an inclusive university.</p>

Such models have proven successful in many diverse applications such as computational chemistry, biology, drug design, and social network analysis; however theoretical frameworks for understanding their expressivity - that is their power  - are scarce. Analysis of the expressivity of graph based models is either done empirically using standard data sets (as determined by the literature) or with recourse to their comparison with the Weisfeiler Lehmann (WL) heuristics for graph isomorphism testing. The latter has proven successful in both understanding the sufficient conditions for optimising the expressivity of a standard GNN as well as the development of more expressive models such as k-GNNs. However, several seminal publications have demonstrated that GNNs that are determined expressive in the WL framework perform poorly on substructure identification tasks. Such tasks are crucial for the aforementioned applications and, consequently, the scope of expressivity must encompass them. In this presentation we explore the fundamentals of GNNs and their importance as a model class in machine learning. We discuss the Weisfeiler-Lehman framework for expressivity, providing examples of how these heuristics compare to the computational capabilities of standard GNNs and hence allow us to better understand their behaviour.  Furthermore, we consider why GNNs struggle on tasks that involve substructure identification and hence motivate the application of concepts in algebraic topology for the development of new topologically informed graph neural networks.</p>

Recent mainstream technological trends associated with the Internet of Things and the widespread presence of robots in professional, social, and domestic settings have increased interest in this approach. In this presentation, we highlight the main aspects and open problems identified in surveys related to the topic. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions to develop an enhanced approach to EUD, allowing the robot itself to autonomously contribute to solving previously unseen tasks through activities programmed by users.</p>

Although these are trained on datasets spanning large domains, not all topics can be covered. In some specific cases, we may want a model to be able to answer questions that refer to private documents, and therefore are not included in the datasets on which a model may have been trained, and to do so in a reliable and content-controlled way. Private texts can be semantically structured in databases or knowledge graphs. Fine-tuning a model would require the creation of ad hoc annotated datasets for these documents, which would be time consuming and resource intensive. On the other hand, direct prompting to LLMs without any tuning can lead to incorrect or inaccurate answers and thus hallucinations. We therefore want an LLM to be able to answer questions and then generate text from the documents stored in a structured way. The aim is to extend current work focused on text generation, which currently only takes simple knowledge graphs into account.</p>

However, NN models are often overparameterized, with billions of parameters, requiring substantial memory and computational resources. These models consist of layers such as fully connected or convolutional layers, containing large matrices due to overparameterization. Predictions involve intensive matrix operations, adding to the computational load. In this seminar, we will present the techniques that are present today in the state of art, these techniques can be divided into two: lossy and lossless, this means that you can compress matrices loosing information or not loosing information. Then, we will discuss the problems of this topic and possible research studies that can be made.</p>

          <p class="abstract collapse mt-2" id="talk-0762599efc47fbbdc00297189827fb14">Recent years have witnessed significant advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with the rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) fueled by large datasets and increased model complexity. However, the demand for substantial computational resources poses challenges, especially in decentralized data scenarios. Edge Intelligence (EI), combining Edge Computing (EC) and AI, emerges as a transformative solution for decentralized learning, crucial in the era of IoT proliferation. Federated Learning (FL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) represent prominent paradigms in decentralized learning, each with its unique challenges and opportunities. This seminar delves into the development of KD as a decentralized learning method, exploring its principles, unresolved challenges, and promising research avenues.</p>

          <p class="abstract collapse mt-2" id="talk-d0da46ee9bd422789dfadf91cd2ebc3c">Distributed computing has a long history, starting from the introduction of time-sharing techniques in the 1960s to the rise of cloud computing in the last two decades. However, the recent introduction of advanced technologies in areas such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, and Industry 4.0, demands a rethinking of cloud paradigms. In this seminar, we introduce two cutting-edge technologies in Cloud Computing: Serverless Computing and Cloud Continuum. Serverless Computing allows developers to write and deploy code without managing the underlying infrastructure, enhancing flexibility and scalability. Cloud Continuum extends cloud computing beyond traditional data centers, integrating computational resources distributed across the network including cloud, fog, edge and IoT. The main goal of this seminar is to provide insights into the potential implications and limitations of these two technologies in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we explore key research directions and present current open challenges.</p>
