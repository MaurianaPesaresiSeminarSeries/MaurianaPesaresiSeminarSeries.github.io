          <p>UNESCO data from 2017 shows a staggering ‚Äúlearning crisis‚Äù affecting millions of people, especially students with disabilities. To combat this, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) emerged in the 1990s, advocating for a tailored curriculum. Studies emphasize how appropriate use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can accelerate the adoption and application of UDL in various educational systems and benefit students with disabilities. Among ICTs, Virtual and Augmented Reality appear to have great potential for UDL as they are attention-grabbing and create immersive, personalized experiences that are difficult to replicate in person. Despite their potential, VR and AR are still little used in real educational contexts and most proposals in the literature relate to children. The seminar will focus on a systematic literature review that identifies research gaps, such as the lack of guidelines that inform and guide the design and development of AR apps, and the lack of attention given to the orientation and university education of students with disabilities. It identifies a number of open problems holding back the use of immersive technologies in the university environment and concludes with suggestions for an inclusive university.</p>

Such models have proven successful in many diverse applications such as computational chemistry, biology, drug design, and social network analysis; however theoretical frameworks for understanding their expressivity - that is their power  - are scarce. Analysis of the expressivity of graph based models is either done empirically using standard data sets (as determined by the literature) or with recourse to their comparison with the Weisfeiler Lehmann (WL) heuristics for graph isomorphism testing. The latter has proven successful in both understanding the sufficient conditions for optimising the expressivity of a standard GNN as well as the development of more expressive models such as k-GNNs. However, several seminal publications have demonstrated that GNNs that are determined expressive in the WL framework perform poorly on substructure identification tasks. Such tasks are crucial for the aforementioned applications and, consequently, the scope of expressivity must encompass them. In this presentation we explore the fundamentals of GNNs and their importance as a model class in machine learning. We discuss the Weisfeiler-Lehman framework for expressivity, providing examples of how these heuristics compare to the computational capabilities of standard GNNs and hence allow us to better understand their behaviour.  Furthermore, we consider why GNNs struggle on tasks that involve substructure identification and hence motivate the application of concepts in algebraic topology for the development of new topologically informed graph neural networks.</p>

Recent mainstream technological trends associated with the Internet of Things and the widespread presence of robots in professional, social, and domestic settings have increased interest in this approach. In this presentation, we highlight the main aspects and open problems identified in surveys related to the topic. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions to develop an enhanced approach to EUD, allowing the robot itself to autonomously contribute to solving previously unseen tasks through activities programmed by users.</p>

We will present the state-of-the-art support data structures based on different kinds of tries, describing also the current open problem related to dynamic string dictionaries. In the second part, we will discuss how to augment indexing data structures with machine learning. While the literature provides learned indexes for numerical values that are more effective w.r.t. the classical counterpart, the problem is still open for strings.</p>
