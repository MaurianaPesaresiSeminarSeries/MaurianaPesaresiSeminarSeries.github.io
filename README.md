## Maruiana Pesaresi Seminar Series

The Mauriana Pesaresi seminar series is the seminar series organised and attended by our Ph.D. students. <br>
It consists of a series of meetings where one Ph.D. student presents an open research problem and all participants contribute to discussing it.


The presenter spends at least half an hour introducing the problem to have at least half an hour for the discussion. <br>
To get the credits for this seminar series, each student must attend 80% of the seminars and be the presenter of one of them. <br>
