        | Modern applications are developed into sets of hundreds of interacting microservices that implement one business logic. Such a result is achieved through a collaborative, incremental and iterative development process. Furthermore, the Cloud paradigm has shown some drawbacks in supporting new-generation microservice-based applications. To tame such limitations, Cloud-Edge computing paradigms emerged to bring computation closer to end-users, by exploiting computing, storage, and networking resources along a multi-layered continuum from the Cloud, through Edge, to IoT nodes. In this context, microservices are to be orchestrated over large-scale, pervasive, heterogeneous Cloud-Edge resources to meet application requirements continuously. The constant infrastructural changes and the iterative development process require scalable and continuous orchestration capabilities to manage application deployments and guarantee all requirements by promptly reacting to infrastructure or application changes at runtime. Thus in this talk, we analyse and discuss the key factors and problems arising in the orchestration of multiservice applications in Cloud-Edge infrastructures.
