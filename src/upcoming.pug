        | Structure from motion (SfM) is a photogrammetric imaging technique that refers to estimating 3D object models using a range of 2D images. 3D object models can be constructed from a 2D video sequence taken using a hand-held camera. However, processing all frames leads to a very high computational complexity and poor results. Automatic key frame selection significantly reduces computational time and improves the accuracy of Structure from Motion pipelines. In the first stage, features are extracted and tracked throughout the sequence. In a second stage stereo matching is used to obtain a detailed estimate of the geometry of the observed scene and compute frame-to-frame Homography and Fundamental matrices. Finally, a geometric robust information criterion (GRIC) is computed to decide the removal of this frame. The method has been tested on a test scenario containing some stationary scenes and experiments show that the proposed method is able to discard the frames corresponding to stationary scenes.
