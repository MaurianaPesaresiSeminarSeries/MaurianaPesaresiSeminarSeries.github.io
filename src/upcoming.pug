        | End-User Development (EUD) is a research topic that aims to allow people without programming experience with concepts, methods, and tools enabling them to create or modify their applications. Recent mainstream technological trends associated with the Internet of Things and the widespread presence of robots in professional, social, and domestic settings have increased interest in this approach. In this presentation, we highlight the main aspects and open problems identified in surveys related to the topic. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions to develop an enhanced approach to EUD, allowing the robot itself to autonomously contribute to solving previously unseen tasks through activities programmed by users.
