        | Concept-based methods attempt to interpret existing neural networks or to design inherently interpretable models by exploiting human-comprehensible concepts. In the current talk, I will present few significant examples of such methods, discussing their commonalities, their underlying assumptions, and their applications. More in detail, I will focus on the semantic alignment of neural directions and visual concepts in CNNs for computer vision. In this context, different existing approaches might be understood in terms of a unified general framework. Furthermore, I will show the impact of acknowledging semantic relations on such framework. Finally, the talk discusses the main issues affecting concept-based methods and hints to possible research strategies to tackle them.
