        | UNESCO data from 2017 shows a staggering ‚Äúlearning crisis‚Äù affecting millions of people, especially students with disabilities. To combat this, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) emerged in the 1990s, advocating for a tailored curriculum. Studies emphasize how appropriate use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can accelerate the adoption and application of UDL in various educational systems and benefit students with disabilities. Among ICTs, Virtual and Augmented Reality appear to have great potential for UDL as they are attention-grabbing and create immersive, personalized experiences that are difficult to replicate in person. Despite their potential, VR and AR are still little used in real educational contexts and most proposals in the literature relate to children. The seminar will focus on a systematic literature review that identifies research gaps, such as the lack of guidelines that inform and guide the design and development of AR apps, and the lack of attention given to the orientation and university education of students with disabilities. It identifies a number of open problems holding back the use of immersive technologies in the university environment and concludes with suggestions for an inclusive university.
