        | With the increased use of mobile devices, which capture information from users' locations using GPS and /3G/4G hotspots/cells, the trajectory data created from their spatio-temporal evolution has grown considerably. Furthermore, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), popularization of social networks and mobile devices, a massive amount of data has been produced every single second. This data can be generated by smart vehicles, houses, sensors, watches, appliances, as well as social networks (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin) and location-based services. We can use this data from these sources to enrich the trajectory components. They can be related to the object (e.g. heartbeat, mood, blood pressure, sleep, age, occupation, gender) or the location (e.g. description, temperature, air and noise pollution, category, assessments). This diversified type of data has its characteristics and, when combined to trajectories, creates a new intricate trajectory model. This complex and heterogeneous trajectory that contains numerous dimensions is known as multiple aspects trajectory. This data can be useful for several areas of knowledge, including security, urban planning, public transport management, and epidemic prevention. However, the publication of such data may put the privacy of users at risk. Stalking can be facilitated if malicious persons have access to this data, as well as operational support for committing crimes, leading to a threat to the people's safety. In this seminar, we will talk about the current challenges related to privacy and multiple aspects trajectories.
