        | Quantum computing is a promising emerging technology, that exploits non-classical phenomena described by quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and superposition. Quantum algorithms are predicted to have a exponential speedup with respect to their classical counterparts. Due to technological limitations, however, we still have not reached ‚ÄúQuantum Supremacy‚Äù, the point where a quantum computer is undeniably faster than classical ones. Larger and more powerful quantum computer are being built each year, but at the same time faster and smarter algorithm to simulate them are being developed, and it is still not clear who will win this arm race.
