        | The proliferation of interconnected devices, capable of generating huge amounts of data, requires highly performing applications to extract insights. These needs amplify the demand of new scalable algorithms and programming interfaces, both for shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures. Currently, the standard tools to approach this challenge are either too complex or unflexible for programmers. This research aimed to propose a new distributed-memory run-time system for FastFlowâ€™s building-blocks. FastFlow is a C++ structured parallel programming library, originally targeting shared-memory platforms. This new support allowed the exploitation of the parallel resources of multiple interconnected machines. The main target of the proposed run-time system was to enable an easy and smooth transition between shared-memory FastFlow applications to equivalent distributed-memory ones. A preliminary analysis of the new run-time system reported considerable benefits from the programmability and flexibility points of view. Additionally, a set of experiments, based both on real and artificial programs, validated the presented solution, demonstrating a significant performance gain and ability to fully exploit the resources of a cluster of machines.
