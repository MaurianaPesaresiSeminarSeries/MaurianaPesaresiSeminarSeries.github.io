10/2/2023,Giuseppe Bisicchia,Orchestrating Applications in the Cloud-Edge Continuum,"Modern applications are developed into sets of hundreds of interacting microservices that implement one business logic. Such a result is achieved through a collaborative, incremental and iterative development process. Furthermore, the Cloud paradigm has shown some drawbacks in supporting new-generation microservice-based applications. To tame such limitations, Cloud-Edge computing paradigms emerged to bring computation closer to end-users, by exploiting computing, storage, and networking resources along a multi-layered continuum from the Cloud, through Edge, to IoT nodes. In this context, microservices are to be orchestrated over large-scale, pervasive, heterogeneous Cloud-Edge resources to meet application requirements continuously. The constant infrastructural changes and the iterative development process require scalable and continuous orchestration capabilities to manage application deployments and guarantee all requirements by promptly reacting to infrastructure or application changes at runtime. Thus in this talk, we analyse and discuss the key factors and problems arising in the orchestration of multiservice applications in Cloud-Edge infrastructures.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,17:00-18:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NmloYnI3cHA0Y2Zxc3VxaG9tY3R1aXNrYzAgY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com
17/2/2023,Gabriele Tedeschi,Dynamic methods for quantum program verification,"Quantum computing is a promising emerging technology, but its counterintuitive rules make it difficult to design and implement quantum algorithms. In the classical setting, the programmer can rely on automated verification techniques, in order to prove that an algorithm is correct and satisfies the desired requirements. The classical techniques, however, suffer from exponential computational cost when applied to the quantum setting. We will review some of the proposed approaches and their shortcomings, and discuss some possible future paths.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,17:00-18:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NWFhMjY3ZG43ODgxaXAwOGppMWU5ZTIzOXAgY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com

31/3/2023,Elia Piccoli,Continual Reinforcement Learning: towards Multi-Task and Generic Agents,"In recent years, Reinforcement Learning has reached astonishing results and advancements in various research fields and applications such as games, robotics and chemistry. However, this has come at the cost of unsustainable computational efforts given the huge and complex deep architectures. A common characteristic of all state of art approaches is that the agent learns to solve a very specific task without reusing previously learned skills or knowledge. Continual Learning, on the other hand, seeks to create models that are able to incrementally learn from a sequence of tasks, while continually acquiring, fine-tuning, and transferring knowledge and skills throughout different tasks. As each task is temporally limited and discarded, the ability to forget and maintain knowledge is a critical and fundamental aspect. Continual Reinforcement Learning aims at creating agents that learn multiple tasks in a sequential fashion, trying to extend their abilities without loss of performances in previously learnt scenarios. But at the same time, agents are able to re-use or transfer previous knowledge to ease the process of learning a new task. In this presentation, I will cover the current state-of-the-art and analyze possible ideas that may help to improve the agent's performances and capabilities.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,16:00-17:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NnUzYmFlcmxibGhnNnNsdWo1cDc5bmM3NW4gY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com
