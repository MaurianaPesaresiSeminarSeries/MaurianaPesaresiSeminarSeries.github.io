10/2/2023,Giuseppe Bisicchia,Orchestrating Applications in the Cloud-Edge Continuum,"Modern applications are developed into sets of hundreds of interacting microservices that implement one business logic. Such a result is achieved through a collaborative, incremental and iterative development process. Furthermore, the Cloud paradigm has shown some drawbacks in supporting new-generation microservice-based applications. To tame such limitations, Cloud-Edge computing paradigms emerged to bring computation closer to end-users, by exploiting computing, storage, and networking resources along a multi-layered continuum from the Cloud, through Edge, to IoT nodes. In this context, microservices are to be orchestrated over large-scale, pervasive, heterogeneous Cloud-Edge resources to meet application requirements continuously. The constant infrastructural changes and the iterative development process require scalable and continuous orchestration capabilities to manage application deployments and guarantee all requirements by promptly reacting to infrastructure or application changes at runtime. Thus in this talk, we analyse and discuss the key factors and problems arising in the orchestration of multiservice applications in Cloud-Edge infrastructures.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,17:00-18:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NmloYnI3cHA0Y2Zxc3VxaG9tY3R1aXNrYzAgY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com
17/2/2023,Gabriele Tedeschi,The arms race between Quantum Supremacy and classical simulation,"Quantum computing is a promising emerging technology, that exploits non-classical phenomena described by quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and superposition. Quantum algorithms are predicted to have a exponential speedup with respect to their classical counterparts. Due to technological limitations, however, we still have not reached “Quantum Supremacy”, the point where a quantum computer is undeniably faster than classical ones. Larger and more powerful quantum computer are being built each year, but at the same time faster and smarter algorithm to simulate them are being developed, and it is still not clear who will win this arm race.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,17:00-18:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NWFhMjY3ZG43ODgxaXAwOGppMWU5ZTIzOXAgY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com

10/3/2023,Sara Joubbi,Protein-protein interactions using Deep Learning: application in antibody design,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) describe the physical contacts between two or more proteins and are crucial for a wide range of biological processes, including cell signaling and metabolic and developmental control. The study of PPIs is of pivotal importance for understanding molecular mechanisms, drug design, and the study of mutations. In recent years, many computational PPI prediction techniques have been developed to compensate for the excessive costs and technical limitations of wet-lab experiments (e.g., Deep Learning (DL)). Using DL for PPIs can help design new molecules (e.g., antibodies) with specific structural and functional requirements. This seminar will highlight the main issues in antibody-antigen interaction prediction and de-novo antibody design.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,16:00-17:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=N3IzNmJrNjc2OWVpODNsOTl1OTk5MDBzb2UgY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com

31/3/2023,Elia Piccoli,Continual Reinforcement Learning: towards Multi-Task and Generic Agents,"In recent years, Reinforcement Learning has reached astonishing results and advancements in various research fields and applications such as games, robotics and chemistry. However, this has come at the cost of unsustainable computational efforts given the huge and complex deep architectures. A common characteristic of all state of art approaches is that the agent learns to solve a very specific task without reusing previously learned skills or knowledge. Continual Learning, on the other hand, seeks to create models that are able to incrementally learn from a sequence of tasks, while continually acquiring, fine-tuning, and transferring knowledge and skills throughout different tasks. As each task is temporally limited and discarded, the ability to forget and maintain knowledge is a critical and fundamental aspect. Continual Reinforcement Learning aims at creating agents that learn multiple tasks in a sequential fashion, trying to extend their abilities without loss of performances in previously learnt scenarios. But at the same time, agents are able to re-use or transfer previous knowledge to ease the process of learning a new task. In this presentation, I will cover the current state-of-the-art and analyze possible ideas that may help to improve the agent's performances and capabilities.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,16:00-17:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NnUzYmFlcmxibGhnNnNsdWo1cDc5bmM3NW4gY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com

5/5/2023,Tauheed Waheed,The impact of IOT cyber-security in perspective of industry 4.0,"It is evident that digitalization and automation, bought a lot of business benefits but modern industrial systems require more efficient, trusted, and secured ways of communication. The trend of developing innovative and smart architectures notably in the fields of manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and agriculture. To build these smart systems, the utilization of more IoT devices is increasing day by day. Industry leaders want to define clear business models and processes, which are reusable reliable reproducible and can be monitored adequately. Industry 4.0 provides connectivity and interconnectivity among industrial systems which has increased the number of IoT devices with broader challenges. It is paramount to mention that IoT ecosystem is supported by cloud solutions and data analytics to extract appropriate information for making our decisions. In this type of systems cyber-security becomes vital to have secure communication. In recent time Google cloud Microsoft Azure and Amazon are the most established cloud platforms because of their easy integration with IoT. Despite being world best robust, trusted, reliable commercial solutions the number of IoT devices are increasing in their system and indirectly it's expanding the surface of cyber-security threats and attacks. However, without secure communication It becomes quite difficult to use IoT systems.",Sala Riunioni Ovest,16:00-17:00,https://meet.google.com/xgq-arig-zzs,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NDg4MWduamNoOHJ0ZnI1Z3Y2ZG1kZDNwbzYgY191MGNvOWZxb28xNTk3bWZydGFwdG1jMTlyMEBn&tmsrc=c_u0co9fqoo1597mfrtaptmc19r0%40group.calendar.google.com
